Welcome to my Rawang Language NLP Project, developed as part of my BE thesis. This project focuses on word segmentation (tokenization) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging for the Rawang language, a lesser-studied language spoken by a small community in northern Myanmar. Word segmentation is the process of breaking a sentence into meaningful words, a fundamental step in Natural Language Processing (NLP), while POS tagging assigns grammatical categories such as Noun, Verb, and Adverb to segmented words. To achieve this, the Maximum Matching algorithm is used for word segmentation, and Conditional Random Fields (CRF), a machine learning model, is employed for POS tagging. By developing these core NLP components, this project aims to promote the digital presence of the Rawang language and contribute to its computational linguistics research.
